# ANALYSIS-OF-CANCER-RATE-DATA-ACROSS-DEMOGRAPHICS-AND-STATES

Project Overview
The objective of this project was to explore how cancer rates vary among different population groups and across states. By understanding these disparities, the analysis aims to provide valuable insights for public health initiatives, policy-making, and awareness programs.

Key Findings and Insights

1)Age Disparities: The analysis revealed that individuals aged over 64 have an 80% higher cancer rate compared to those aged between 45-64. This highlights the increasing risk of cancer with advancing age.

2)Gender Differences: Males have a 30% higher cancer rate compared to females, suggesting a need for targeted interventions and awareness programs among men.

3)Cancer Type Disparities:

-Lung cancer rates are 50% higher than breast cancer rates.
-Lung cancer rates are 20% higher than colorectal cancer rates.
-These findings emphasize the significant risk posed by lung cancer relative to other common cancer types.

4)Racial Variations: The analysis showed substantial disparities among different racial groups:

-Cancer rates are 20% higher among Black individuals compared to White individuals.
-Cancer rates are 30% lower among Asian individuals compared to White individuals.
-These variations indicate the importance of considering racial factors in cancer prevention and treatment strategies.

5)Geographic Differences: There is a considerable variation in cancer rates across different states, with the highest cancer rate states having up to 40% higher rates compared to states with the lowest rates. This suggests that geographic factors, such as environmental exposure and access to healthcare, may play a significant role in cancer incidence.
